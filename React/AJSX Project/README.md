📘 GitHub Profile Card (React + Tailwind CSS)

This is a beginner-level project I built as part of my Day 5 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. The app fetches my GitHub profile data using the GitHub Users API and renders it as a simple, responsive card.


🛠️ Features

1.✅ Fetches GitHub user data using XMLHttpRequest (old-school way!)

2.✅ Displays:

  -Profile picture
  
  -Username
  
  -Followers count
  
3.✅ "Fetch" button to retrieve and render the profile card

4.✅ "Delete" button to hide the card

5.✅ Fully styled with Tailwind CSS

6.✅ Conditional rendering to hide/show the card based on state
